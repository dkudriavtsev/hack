# Radiation-hardened Quine

Keywords: Quine Ruby Perl

mame defined "radiation-hardened Quine" as "a Quine which works even
after any one characters is deleted" and implemented the first version
in Ruby: https://github.com/mame/radiation-hardened-quine

[robust_quine.pl](robust_quine.pl) is its Perl version, written by
myself.
