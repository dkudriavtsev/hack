[ppencode_py.html](http://shinh.skr.jp/obf/ppencode_py.html)

[nishiohirokazu's found a way to write Python code only with lower case alphabets, parenthesis, and commas](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20120906/1346938523).

There are also Quines with the same restriction:

[for Python 2](alparen_quine.py)

[for Python 3](alparen_quine.py3)

These Quines are using some more tricks than ppencode_py mainly to
reduce the size of code. Two important tricks are creditted to
@mametter and @phoenixstarhiro.
